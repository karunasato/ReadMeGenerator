# README Generator



## Description

index.js file has the array of questions prompted to the user that will create the readMe file, with headers including title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions.

generateMarkdown.js has the formatting of how the readMe file that is produced with the user's inputs to the prompts they answer.
